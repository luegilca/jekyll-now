First of all, I would like to thank [barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark) for building a wonderful tutorial to create static content websites, his [Jekyll Now project](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) has been a great help to create this small site.

The main reason to start this personal blog is the motivation given by the subject Visual Computing during the 2018 first academic period of the undergraduate degree in Systems Engineering.
